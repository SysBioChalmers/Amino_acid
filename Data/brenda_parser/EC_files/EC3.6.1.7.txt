KCAT	Pyrococcus horikoshii	-999	more	*experimentally, it is impossible to assay the enzyme activity of the enzyme directly at 98&deg;C because the uncatalyzed hydrolysis of the acyl-phosphate substrate is too fast at high temperatures to allow an accurate measurement of kinetic parameters. Instead, the kinetic parameters of the enzyme are measured at 25-45 &deg;C and the kcat value of the enzyme at 98 &deg;C is estimated by linear extrapolation of the Arrhenius plot. The estimated kcat value is 10000/s
