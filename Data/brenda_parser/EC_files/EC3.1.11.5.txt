KCAT	Escherichia coli	-999	more	*The corrected unwinding rate is 443 base pairs 1/sec, which is due to a single molecule of enzyme that bound to the free double-stranded DNA end opposite the bead, and both translocates and unwinds the DNA in an ATP-dependent manner once the DNA entered the ATP channel. The rate of unwinding increases with increasing ATP concentration and increasing temperature
