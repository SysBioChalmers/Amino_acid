KCAT	Gallus gallus	-999	more	*steady-state kinetics: comparison of smooth muscle myosin II and non-muscle myosin IIB as substrates, overview. MLCK has an about 2fold higher kcat for both smooth muscle myosin II substrates compared with non-muscle myosin IIB substrates, whereas Km values are very similar
