KCAT	Escherichia virus T4	-999	more	*the kinetic mechanism of single-turnover nick sealing by T4 Rnl2-AMP is explored by using a rapid mix-quench method and the effects of 3'-OH mispairs and base damage lesions on the rates of nick 5'-adenylylation and phosphodiester synthesis is determined. With respect to the sealing of perfectly paired nicks the rates of step 2 catalysis are rapid (9.5-17.9/sec) and similar in magnitude to the step 3 rates (7.9-32/sec). Rnl2 is kinetically sensitive to all 3'-OH base mispairs
