KCAT	Homo sapiens	-999	hyaluronan	*kinetic measurement on hyaluronan substrates with sizes ranging from 90 to 752 kDa. kcat: 40.5-42.4/s. A simple and sensitive method is developed for kinetic measurement of recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20) on hyaluronan substrates with sizes ranging from 90 to 752 kDa. The method is based on 2-aminobenzamide labeling of hydrolyzed hyaluronan products combined with separation by size exclusion-ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with fluorescence detection
